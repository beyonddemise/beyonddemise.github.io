  <h2>The idea that changed everything</h2>
  <p>
    It all started with a near-death experience. Our founder, Steve, was in a
    serious cycling accident that left him hospitalised for weeks. During his
    recovery, he couldn't stop thinking about what would have happened to his
    digital life if he hadn't survived. Who would have access to his accounts?
    How would his loved ones be notified? What about the unfinished letter to
    his estranged father?
  </p>

  <p>
    This brush with mortality sparked an idea: a secure way to manage our
    digital legacies and ensure our final wishes are respected, even after we're
    gone.
