  <h2>The idea that changed everything</h2>
  <p>
    It all started with a near-death experience. Our founder, Sarah, was in a
    serious car accident that left her hospitalized for weeks. During her
    recovery, she couldn't stop thinking about what would have happened to her
    digital life if she hadn't survived. Who would have access to her accounts?
    How would her loved ones be notified? What about the unfinished letter to
    her estranged father? This brush with mortality sparked an idea: a secure
    way to manage our digital legacies and ensure our final wishes are
    respected, even after we're gone.
